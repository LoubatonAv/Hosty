The final project made during the Coding Academy fullstack bootcamp.
A web app inspired by Airbnb for renting sites for vacation.

### What i've learned?
The project taught me how to work as a part of a team effeciently under a deadline and new ways of coding diifferent components and functions (along with many new features,hooks,functions etc..)

### Technologies used

* ReactJS
* NodeJS
* SASS
* Express
* MongoDB


### About
This project was developed by me together with 2 other talented students, however, I took some time after the course to improve learn and add more functionality and responsiveness to the app eager and motivated to see what more can I achieve and see the final result of a big project.


### Why Airbnb?

I wanted to learn and deal with the challenging aspect of a big website and it's components.
The pixel perfect responsiveness and animations were also great practice for me to try and achieve a pixel perfect website along with websockets that allow online updating statuses between a host and a user.
