# Hosty
The final project made during the Coding Academy fullstack bootcamp. A web app inspired by airbnb for renting sites for vacation. Made with MongoDB, Express, ReactJS and NodeJS
this project was made by me together with 2 other students, however, I took some time after the course to improve and add more functionality to the app.
